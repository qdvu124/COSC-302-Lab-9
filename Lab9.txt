I used the array of linked list approach to represent the graph. The rationale behind this is that we are doing a search in our algorithm, and using a 2D array would cause unnecessary checks for nodes that are not neighbors of the currently explored node. I used BFS as the search algorithm of choice. I maintain a HashSet to keep track of the nodes that have been visited, and a LinkedList to represent the queue of nodes to be explored. Each time a node is explored, we check if the node is already explored, if not, we add it to the set of visited nodes. Then we loop through the adjacency list of the current node, adding its neighbor if it has not been exlored and is not yet in the queue. Continue the process until the queue is empty.
